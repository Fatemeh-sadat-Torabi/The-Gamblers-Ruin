# The-Gamblers-Ruin
Gambler's Ruin problem: Consider a gambler who starts with an initial fortune of stake$ and then on each successive gamble either wins $1 or loses $1 independent of the
past with probabilities p and q = 1âˆ’p respectively (here I take 50 percent for either win or lose just like coin tossing). Stake has constant value , cash keeps changes. If
cash get zero the Gambler will go to rack and ruin and if he get to goal value he will win! 
Output of this problem is answer of two questions! How much is chance of win? How many moves is needed to win in average?
I use monte carlo to solve this problem!
